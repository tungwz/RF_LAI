# Urban tree LAI for urban climate modeling 
This repository is used to produce urban tree LAI and data analysis associated with the manuscript:
> "A Global Urban Tree Leaf Area Index Dataset for Urban Climate Modeling"

Code for model train and produce data can be found in the model_code directory and associated manuscript figures are available at plot_Fig directory.
